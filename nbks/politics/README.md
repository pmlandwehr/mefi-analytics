# Political Discussion on MetaFilter Over Time
## About
At the tail end of March there was a [meta-dicussion on MetaFilter](https://metatalk.metafilter.com/24387/Visualizing-the-impact-of-US-politics-megaposts-on-the-blue) about the impact of recent political discussions on user activity. As has had happened during previous American election cycles, politics had come to dominate the site's climate. This time around, in order to cope with an even greater volume of political news than had been seen during the previous Presidential cycles, the moderators ended up routing most political discussion into catch-all "MegaThreads".

User [strangely stunted trees](https://www.metafilter.com/user/96190) had looked at the established trend of a declining volume of site comments, broke out those that were occurring in political threads, and suggested that the political discussion was dominating user activity in a way that was detrimental to the the site as a whole. Their three big points were:
1. More comments on the frontpage ("the blue") are in the MegaThreads than are not
2. Fewer posts are being made
3. Fewer users are commenting

...and their conclusion was that "To preserve the long term viability of the blue, the moderators and the userbase at large should consider policies and behaviors that could curtail the growth of the megathreads and encourage participation on a broader variety of topics by a wider set of users."

I was a bit skeptical of that interpretation -it takes several trends that appear to have common correlations and assumes causality -and so figured that I would take a crack at validating on and expanding the findings.

## This analysis
There are a few different components of this analysis, the first of which is **replication**. strangely stunted trees reported a few precise findings, and those should be reproducible.

The second element of the analysis is a **reconsideration** in an attempt to reject a basic assumption: that the introduction of political MegaThreads on the front page caused a steepening decline in the volume of activity on the site.

As a corollary to this, I'd like to consider an alternate method of measuring activity. While the decreasing volume of comments on the front page is important, I'm more interesting in measuring the number of active users. How many distinct users in a particular time period have posted, commented, or marked a comment or post as a "favorite"? All of these are visible indicators of interaction with the site, and are necessary in forming a complete picture of the user base.

The third element of the analysis is an **examination** of political activity on the site over time: Politics have always been discussed on MetaFilter, and considerations of the recent bursts of activity should be considered in light of that. Even if we accept that increasing political discussion isn't responsible for a decline in usage, it would be good to have an over-arching understanding of these trends.
