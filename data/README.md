# About
This is a *dummy* folder. If you want to run any of the analyses again, you should put an  `infodump.h5` file in here, built from [the MetaFilter Infodump](http://stuff.metafilter.com/infodump/) using [this community-provided gist](https://gist.github.com/goingtomaine/0d920ae9c12ef5409e804287557f7564).

You can also download a compressed infodump file from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6G4jUY7spbSLWdVZjY2V0FkQ1E?usp=sharing).Please bear in mind that it might be out-of-date relative to the analyses.
